## Mode: free-tier fallback

The workspace is on Asana's **free tier**, where **portfolios** (Advanced only)
and **custom fields** (Starter+) are not available. The connector therefore runs
in `NWW_FREE_TIER_FALLBACK=true` mode:

- No portfolio is created; `ASANA_PORTFOLIO_ID` is left unset.
- Metrics are written into the **task description** plus a fenced
  **`Metrics JSON`** block (schema `nww.metrics.v1`) rather than custom fields.
- Planned fields — Resonance Score, Technique Mastery, Copy Technique Success,
  Soul Alignment, Last Reported, Metrics JSON — are carried as keys inside that
  JSON block.

## Browser safety (hard requirement)

The Asana PAT must **never** appear in a client/browser bundle. All Asana
reporting runs **server-side / CLI only**. No adapter code that ships to the
browser may read `ASANA_API_TOKEN`, `localStorage`, or `sessionStorage` for
Asana credentials.

## Upgrade path

On upgrade to a paid plan:
1. Create the 6 custom fields and attach them to project `1216393144202019`.
2. Record the field GIDs in `.env` (add `ASANA_CUSTOM_FIELD_*`).
3. Flip `ASANA_TIER=starter` (or higher) and `NWW_FREE_TIER_FALLBACK=false`.
4. The existing project + task GIDs remain valid — no re-bootstrap needed.
